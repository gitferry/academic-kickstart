# Biography

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at School of Engineering, University of British Columbia, supervised by [Prof. Chen Feng](https://people.ok.ubc.ca/cfeng01/index.html), who is the co-cluster lead of [Blockchain@UBC](https://blockchain.ubc.ca).
My research interests lie in distributed systems, especially blockchain systems.
Most recently, I have been focusing on building efficient and high-performance consortium blockchains.
