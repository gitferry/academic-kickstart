 abstract = {Sidechain technology has been envisioned as a promising solution to
accelerate today's public blockchains in terms of scalability
and interoperability. By relying on the mainchain for security,
different sidechains can formulate their own rules to reach
consensus. Although the literature has considered the
possibility of using consensus protocols in the sidechain, so
far a tailor-made consensus protocol for sidechains with high
performance and formal security proof has not been attempted. To
fill this gap, we introduce Vulcan, a low overhead, highly
efficient, security provable sidechain protocol. Vulcan makes
use of smart contracts to ensure that only one block proposed in
the sidechain will be enforced on the mainchain in each round,
achieving consensus in an efficient manner. We give formal
specifications of Vulcan which ensures safety and liveness with
$f$ validators (total number of $nâ‰¥ 2f+1$) without online
requirement of clients. For security analysis, we give formal
security definitions and proofs under Universally Composable
Security (UCS) model. As a proof of concept, we implement Vulcan
and evaluate it in Ethereum testnet.},
